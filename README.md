# Improving Ad Click Prediction by Considering Non-displayed Events 

## data generation

We first need to convert Yahoo Music data.

```shell
cd yh.data
vim README.md
```

## preprocess

After we have converted data, some files should be generated before training.

```shell
cd preprocess
vim README.md
```

## code

After having neccesary files and **converted** data, we can train and conduct performance evaluation by grid.sh & do-test.sh

```shell
cd code
vim README.md
```
